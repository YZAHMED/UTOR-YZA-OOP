# 10 Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator

This is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Because testing is key to making code maintainable, you’ll also write unit tests for each part of your code and ensure that it passes all of them.

Link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the tests passing. You’ll need to submit a link to the video : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mf36DxjAgYC1NnPB1V-ptXZ2vYIpUGfE/view?usp=share_link
